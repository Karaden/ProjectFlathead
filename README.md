## Welcome to Project Flathead

The aim of this project is to create a cosplay costume modelled on a robot from the comic series Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye. In one particular story-arc, the characterâ€™s head is removed and replaced with a screen that can display text and some simple images (i.e., he becomes a 'flathead'). I want to develop a working helmet that can recreate this, as a centrepiece for a costume.

Please see the wiki (https://github.com/Karaden/ProjectFlathead/wiki) for more information.
